[Hubbard et al 2019](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/mec.14989) find that root microbes drive a substantial amount of plant defense in Boechera stricta, 
and that plant and root-microbe pathways to defense are different. 
I opine [here](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/mec.15059) on what separate pathways mean for evolution of plant defense, 
and what alternate knock-on effects of microbe- and plant- driven defense on insects could mean for tri-trophic interactions.
