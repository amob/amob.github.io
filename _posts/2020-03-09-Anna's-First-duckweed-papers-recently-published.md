Duckweed host a much simpler microbiome, yet different microbiomes still shift host growth & traits, as in terrestrial plants, at Microbial Ecology:
[Mutualistic Outcomes Across Plant Populations, Microbes, and Environments in the Duckweed _Lemna minor_](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00248-019-01452-1)
<br>

Co-occurring winter stressors reduce duckweed survival and growth, as well as benefits from microbiomes, at AJB:
[Resilience to multiple stressors in an aquatic plant and its microbiome](https://bsapubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ajb2.1404)

This image shows one experimental replicate of duckweed responses to salt (NaCl) & benzotriazole (BZT) stressors, with (+) & without (-) their microbiome, for three separate genotypes of duckweed (MT, KSR, and BH)
