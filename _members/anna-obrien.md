Anna's postdoctoral work at the University of Toronto in the [Frederickson](http://mutualism.ca/), [Rochman](https://rochmanlab.wordpress.com/), and [Sinton](http://www.sintonlab.com/) labs focused on how urban contaminants affect duckweed interactions with their microbiome, and how duckweed-microbe interactions affect biotransformation of urban contaminants.
Anna worked on teosinte in her PhD, asking how climate shaped adaptation to plant-rhizosphere interactions and how adaptation to climate in teosinte might be altered by rhizosphere interactions.
Anna's PhD work was at University of California Davis, in the [Ross-Ibarra](https://rilab.ucdavis.edu/) and [Strauss](https://sharonstrauss.wordpress.com/) labs, and in collaboration with [Dr. Ruairidh Sawers](https://plantscience.psu.edu/directory/rjs6686) (now at PennState) at [LANGEBIO-CINVESTAV](https://langebio.cinvestav.mx/en/) in Guanajuato, Mexico.
